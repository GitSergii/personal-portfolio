Situation: 
LIFECELL.UA is a leading telecom operator in Ukraine that offers various digital services to customers. As the Chief Commercial Officer B2B, I was responsible for overseeing the sales and marketing strategies for the B2B segment, which is highly competitive and demanding. My challenge was to achieve consistent YoY growth and ensure top-notch services for our enterprise clients.

Action: 
To tackle this challenge, I took the following steps:

First, I dedicated time to understand our enterprise and SMB markets inside out, aligning my team’s goals with the company’s larger objectives.
Second, I initiated an aggressive approach to nurture sales teams specifically for these segments. This involved both training for the existing team and headhunting for specialized talent.
Lastly, collaboration became my tool of choice again. I worked closely with other departments to initiate new products, transforming the company’s offerings and ensuring we remained a top choice for diverse B2B clients.

Results: 
Under my leadership, we witnessed a staggering 134% YoY growth in new enterprise clients. It wasn’t just about bringing in new clients, but also about ensuring top-tier services and consistent growth. The journey was challenging but extremely rewarding, and I look back at it with immense pride and satisfaction.
