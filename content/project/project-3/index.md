Situation: life:), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Turkcell, the leading mobile operator in Turkey, wanted to serve its customers in Ukraine under a new brand that reflects its mobile broadband and technology leadership.

Solution: Developed and introduced a new brand - lifecell - within the scope of Turkcell’s brand integration strategy. Redefined target segments and repositioned the brand for future growth. Adopted blue and yellow as the brand colors, bringing lifecell and Turkcell closer in terms of brand identity.

Results: The emergence of the new brand name and identity marked the merger of brand image as a dynamic, young and innovative operator with Turkcell’s technology leadership and experience. Under the brand change, 184 stores in 91 Ukrainian cities as well as digital channels were redesigned with the new visual brand identity - lifecell logo and Turkcell’s brand yellow and blue colors.
