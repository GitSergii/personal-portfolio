Situation:
While serving as Chief Marketing Officer at NOVUS, I identified a pressing issue: despite our broad customer base, we had low conversion rates and customer engagement. Everything was done manually, causing inefficiencies and missed opportunities. Our lack of a centralized CRM system meant we couldn't leverage customer insights for personalized marketing effectively.


Action:
Understanding the limitations of our manual processes, I championed the introduction of a CRM. But before jumping directly into CRM, I laid foundational groundwork by initiating the automation of our customer lifecycle. I spearheaded the implementation of the marketing automation with the Corezoid process engine. This move was crucial as it integrated all our scattered systems, paving the way for a seamless CRM integration. With the automation in place and after robust internal advocacy, I secured buy-in from key stakeholders and initiated the implementation of a CRM system tailored to our needs.


Results:
Post-implementation, our team could now make personalized offers to our customers, enhancing their experience and our brand's value proposition. This strategic move led to a notable boost in transactions by 7.5%, demonstrating the power of effective, data-driven customer engagement. Moreover, the increased efficiency and customer insights set the stage for continued growth and innovation in our marketing strategies.
