Situation:
When I was the Marketing Director at lifecell, we were preparing for the rollout of 3G services for B2C and B2B customers. The challenge was that all our competitors were launching at the same time, and most had heftier marketing budgets.


Action:
Instead of matching competitors' big-budget marketing plays, we initiated early communication campaigns with 3G pre-subscription. This built anticipation and garnered a loyal subscriber base even before the official rollout.
With the team we used the data to segmented our customer base. By fine-tuning communications, pricing strategies, and CRM practices, we ensured rapid 3G adoption.

Results:
Our strategy paid off. We boosted our revenue market share from 14% to 16% and grew our customer base to over 10M. The cherry on top - we earned the Grand Prix EFFIE award for ROMI üôÇ
