Situation:
I had the privilege of leading the B2C segment and running CRM, analytics, and pricing at mobile operator LIFECELL, a subsidiary of Turkcell in Ukraine. We faced a dilemma: how to boost profits without losing our customer base, especially with rising acquisition costs and limited repricing opportunities due to intense competition.

While researching ways to improve customer retention, I came across a study by Bain & Co. that caught my attention. It highlighted that a company's profitability could skyrocket by 75% by improving customer retention by just 5%. It sounded like the answer, but applying it had its challenges. We already had a CRM program in place, but the impact was negligible. The problem was that we were data-rich but insight-poor due to limited data mining resources. Also, our reliance on IT for segmented marketing campaigns was a hurdle, significantly limiting our progress.

Solution:
I championed a solution that involved collaboration with our IT team and Turkcell Technology. Together, we developed an automated marketing campaign system. I took the initiative to learn SQL and then organized training for my retention and pricing teams, ensuring they could easily access our Oracle database.

Results:
With these tools in hand, we understood our customers better and automated various retention efforts, including onboarding, notifications, experimenting A/B testing, drip campaigns, segmented promotions, and loyalty schemes. These steps not only streamlined our operations but also significantly improved our margins. Our customer base has been growing by 8% annually from 2011-2014, far outpacing our competitors. In fact, our CMS became so influential that it was later adopted in 5 other countries.
